                                                            Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It takes its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the algorithm progresses.

Here's how the bubble sort algorithm works:

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements, compare them, and swap if necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 until the end of the list is reached.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more swaps are needed (i.e., the list is sorted).

The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and average case, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm requires two nested loops to traverse the list and compare adjacent elements. In the best case scenario, where the list is already sorted, bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n), as it will only make a single pass over the list without swapping any elements.

Despite its simplicity, bubble sort is not very efficient for large lists, as its time complexity makes it slow compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort. However, bubble sort can be useful for teaching basic sorting concepts or for sorting small lists with few elements.
