                                                        Selection Sort Algorithm
Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. This continues until the entire list is sorted.

Here's how the selection sort algorithm works:

1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the list.
2. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part.
3. Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the list one element to the right.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire list is sorted.

The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and average case, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm requires two nested loops to traverse the list and find the minimum element in each iteration. In the best case scenario, where the list is already sorted, selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) as it still needs to check each element to confirm they are sorted.

Despite its simplicity, selection sort is not very efficient for large lists, as its time complexity makes it slow compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort. However, selection sort can be useful for teaching basic sorting concepts or for sorting small lists with few elements. Another advantage of selection sort is that it has a relatively small number of swaps, making it useful in situations where swapping elements is expensive, such as in embedded systems.
