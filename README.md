### Introduction
In computer science, data structures are used to organize and store data, while algorithms are used to manipulate and process that data. This repository contains a variety of Java programs that implement various data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms.

### Data Structures
This section contains implementations of various data structures in Java, including:

Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
Graphs
Hash Tables
Each data structure is implemented as a separate Java class, along with sample code to demonstrate how to use each class.

### Algorithms
This section contains implementations of various algorithms in Java, including:

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Java class, along with sample code to demonstrate how to use each class.

### Sample Questions
This section contains sample coding questions that require the use of data structures and algorithms. Each question includes a prompt and a solution implemented in Java.
