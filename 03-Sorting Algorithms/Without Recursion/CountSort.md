                                                          Count Sort Algorithm
Cyclic sort is an in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well for arrays with distinct integers in a small range. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to traverse the array and place each element in its correct position by swapping it with the element at the index corresponding to its value. The algorithm works on the assumption that all elements in the input array are in the range 1 to n, where n is the size of the array.

Here are the steps involved in the cyclic sort algorithm:

1. Initialize the current index to 0.
2. While the current index is less than the size of the array, do the following - If the value at the current index is not equal to the current index plus 1, swap the element at the current index with the element at the index corresponding to its value.
If the value at the current index is equal to the current index plus 1 or if the element at the index corresponding to its value is equal to the current element, increment the current index.
3. Return the sorted array.

The time complexity of cyclic sort is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. Since the algorithm involves only one traversal of the array and constant time operations for each element, the time complexity is linear. However, the algorithm requires additional memory for the temporary variable used in swapping, which makes its space complexity O(1). Cyclic sort is best suited for arrays with distinct integers in a small range, as the number of swaps required for sorting the array is equal to the number of misplaced elements.
